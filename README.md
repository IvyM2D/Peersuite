All data is sent only between ckients through encrypted WebRTC channels. There is no server.

The tools included are chat with file send, collaboarative document editing, a kanban board, screen sharing, video calling, and a shared whiteboard for drawing ideas.

This is the initial public release, happy to check out some PRs
